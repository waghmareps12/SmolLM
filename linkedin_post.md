🚀 Excited to share my latest project: Training a 125M Parameter Language Model on Consumer Hardware! 

I've been exploring how to make language model training accessible on modest GPUs, and here are the key findings:

💡 Key Achievements:
- Successfully trained a 125M parameter transformer model on a 4GB GPU
- Implemented efficient memory optimizations to fit training in limited VRAM
- Achieved stable training with gradient accumulation and length-based batching

🛠️ Technical Details:
- Model: 12-layer transformer with 768 embedding dimension
- Memory Usage: ~3.5GB VRAM peak
- Training Time: 4 hours on GTX 1650
- Dataset: Wikitext-2

⚡ Optimizations Implemented:
1. Length-based sequence batching
2. Gradient accumulation (4 steps)
3. Dynamic batch scheduling
4. Pre-norm architecture
5. Efficient memory management

🎯 Why This Matters:
While large language models get most of the attention, there's immense value in being able to train smaller, focused models on consumer hardware. This opens up opportunities for:
- Research and experimentation
- Domain-specific applications
- Educational purposes
- Cost-effective deployment
